        <h1 id="programsMainTitle">Glanbrook Skating Club Programs</h1>
        <h1 class="programHeadings">Pre-Canskate</h1>
        <p1 id="precanText" class="programText">  Pre-CanSkate is a 30 minute learn-to-skate program for 4- & 5-year-olds. Skaters <b>MUST be 4 years old by the 31st of December</b>. Age-appropriate games and activities help preschoolers gain confidence and learn the basics of skating. Children are placed into groups according to ability and taught by Professional Coaches and assisted by a volunteer team of our STARSkaters, trained as Program Assistants. The focus of this program is to develop foundational skills, while making skating fun! Skating skills taught range from learning to stand and balance, to going forwards and backwards. Skating aids will be used at the professional coach's discretion.</p1>

        <h1 class="programHeadings">CanSkate & TeenSkate</h1>
        <p1 id="canText" class="programText">CanSkate, TeenSkate & AdultSkate are dynamic learn-to-skate programs which focus on fun, participation and basic skill development.<br><br>
            CanSkate is for beginners from 6-12, as well as for those wishing to improve their basic skills whether their focus be for figure skating, hockey, speed skating or just skating for fun. TeenSkate & AdultSkate are similar programs, uniquely tailored for their age ranges: 13-17 and 18+ respectively. <br><br>
            The programs are taught by our NCCP-trained professional coaches, assisted by our trained, volunteer program assistants. <br><br>
            The programs aim to teach students a complete series of balance, control, and agility skills taught in six stages of learning that pertain to hockey, ringette, speed skating, and figure skating, as well as general recreational skating. CanSkate uses a nationally tested, proven curriculum, and delivery methods that guarantee skater success in developing stronger basic skills and developing them faster. <br><br>
            Expect action, movement and fun! Lessons are given in a group format with a coach-to-student ratio of a maximum of 1:10. Skaters are able to progress at their own rate, as coaches make sessions active using teaching aids, upbeat music and a wide variety of activities that create a motivational environment, while promoting learning. Badges, ribbons, and other incentives are used to benchmark skaters' progress, and reward effort and participation.</p1>

        <h1 class="programHeadings">Pre-STAR</h1>
        <p1 id="preSTARText" class="programText">Skaters who have achieved CanSkate Stage 4 may wish to advance into our Pre-Junior program. Skaters will complete Stages 5 & 6 of the CanSkate program and learn aspects of the STARSkate program, including dance, freeskate, and skills. This program is taught in a group format; however, skaters are encouraged to supplement this program with a one-on-one private lesson with a professional coach for an additional cost. Parents are encouraged to contact a professional coach directly if they wish to arrange additional lessons for their skater. <b>If interested, please feel free to contact one of our STARSkate coaches about your skater's options.</b></p1>

        <h1 class="programHeadings">STARSkate</h1>
        <p1 id="STARText" class="programText"><b>Skills, Tests, Achievement, Recognition- this is what STARSkate is all about!</b><br><br> 
            Is your CanSkater or Pre-STAR skater ready to progress to the next level? If your skater would like a more intensified program with a private coach, you can arrange private lessons with a member of our professional coaching staff. To arrange this, please reach out either in-person, or via email, found on the <i>Coaches & Board of Directors Page</i>, or to <a href='mailto:glanbrookskating@outlook.com' target='_blank'>glanbrookskating@outlook.com</a>.<br><br> 
            Skaters are eligible to compete at local competitions, and may choose to take tests to progress through the SkateCanada levels of one to gold.<br><br>  
            Skaters must have completed at least CanSkate stage five to enter the test program. <b>Arrangements with a coach must be made prior to registering.</b><br><br>     
            STARSkate offers opportunities for skaters of all ages to develop fundamental figure skating skills in the areas of ice dance, skating skills, freeskate, and interpretive skating. Unique in Canada, this program teaches figure skating skills in a group and/or private lesson format in a progressive, and sequential manner. The program includes specifically designed awards, and incentives such as competition medals/ribbons. Skaters can take Skate Canada Tests through a nationally standardized testing system. Skaters who have mastered figure skating skills in STARSkate may also choose to pursue synchronized skating, pairs skating, or other styles.<br><br>
