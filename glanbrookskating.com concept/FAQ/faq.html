        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p1 id="faqText"><b>1. Who runs the club?</b><br> The Glanbrook Skating Club (GSC) is made up entirely of volunteers. We require volunteers' help for successful seasons! Please email us at <a href="mailto:glanbrookskating@outlook.com">glanbrookskating@outlook.com</a> if you are interested.<br><br><b> 
            2. Are parents allowed on the ice?</b><br> Because we're encouraging our skaters to focus on what they are being taught by the coaches and program assistants (PAs), parents are not allowed on the ice at any time.<br><br><b> 
            3. What do you need to participate?</b><br> All you need are skates, a CSA-approved hockey helmet, long pants, mittens/gloves, and a warm sweater or jacket. Dress in layers- it will get warm! Snow pants are not recommended, as they impede skater movability and make learning much more challenging. Instead, we encourage our younger skaters to wear splash pants, and our older skaters to wear leggings/yoga pants.<br><br>Both figure skates, and hockey skates are fine for our Learn-to-Skate programs; figure skates are required for both our Pre-STAR, and STARSkaters. Both leather, and lace-up skates are preferable to vinyl.  Molded plastic skates with Velcro/clamp closures are a bad choice. They're discouraged by our coaches due to their lack of ankle support and because they cannot be tightened enough to prevent foot movement inside of the skates. <b>Bobskates with the double blade are not suitable for our programs</b>.<br><br><b> 
            4. Does my skater need a helmet?</b><br> <b>CSA-approved hockey helmets are mandatory</b> for all skaters until they have completed Level 5 CanSkate. Bicycle, skiing, equestrian, and other sport helmets do not meet the standards required. For full details, click <a target="_blank" href='https://info.skatecanada.ca/index.php/en-ca/?catid=0&id=50'>here</a>. <b>Face cages are NOT required.</b><br><br><b> 
            5. Can my skater bring a snack or drink?</b><br> Per arena rules, no food and drink are permitted on the ice. Exceptions are made for water bottles.<br><br><b> 
            6. Is there any experience necessary to join your programs?</b><br> No experience is necessary for any of our Learn-to-Skate programs, including CanSkate, Pre-Canskate, TeenSkate, and AdultSkate programs.<br><br><b> 
            7. What rules must skaters follow during STARSkate sessions?</b><br> STARSkaters must keep in mind proper ice etiquette as they skate. Please find the GSC Code of Conduct under the <i>Skater Resources</i> tab.</p1>
